# Time-Series Analysis of Point Loma Real-Time Oceanographic Mooring System
## This project is a part of the ADS-506 course in the Applied Data Science Program at the University of San Diego.
## Project Status: [Completed]

# Project Intro/Objective
## Coastal moorings/mooring systems consist of an anchored buoy configured with instruments suspended in the water column collecting in real-time physical, chemical, and biological observations at one or more depths. Observations include both physical oceanographic (such as salinity, temperature, and currents) and meteorological measurements (such as wind speed and direction, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, etc) (Bailey et al., 2019). Moorings provide a continuous data stream that informs a number of industries including shipping, fishing, energy generation, scientific research, military, coastal and emergency managers, among many others.

# Project Description
## This project uses data collected from the Real-Time Oceanographic Mooring System (RTOMS) located near the terminal ends of the Point Loma ocean outfall in San Diego, CA. The RTOMS, maintained by the Ocean Monitoring Program in partnership with Scripps Institute of Oceanography, is typically deployed at one-year intervals (City of San Diego, 2023). The dataset contains near continuous measurements of water temperatures at various depths from 1 to 87 meters for the year 2022.
